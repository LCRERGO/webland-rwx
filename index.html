    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
    Linux was created by <em><strong>Linux Torvaldz</strong></em> during college while wanting to improve on
    Minix, which hit professor had created.
    </p>

    <h2>Controversy</h2>

    <p>
    Richard Stallman, creator of the GNU utilities wanted to have Linux always
    called by the name GNU/Linux (despite the unpronouncable mothfull that is).
    This name was quickly dropped due to covenience and lack of consideration for
    the thousands of other contributors from other projects outside of the GNU
    project.
