Introduction to Linux

History

Linux was created by Linux Torvaldz during college while wanting to improve on
Minix, which hit professor had created.

Controversy

Richard Stallman, creator of the GNU utilities wanted to have Linux always
called by the name GNU/Linux (despite the unpronouncable mothfull that is).
This name was quickly dropped due to covenience and lack of consideration for
the thousands of other contributors from other projects outside of the GNU
project.
